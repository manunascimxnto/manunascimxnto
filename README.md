Hello! I’m Emanuelle but you can call me Manu <3
I’m interested in technology, electric guitar, horror movies, muaythai, jiujitsu, books & nerdy stuff ^^
I learned a little bit of coding at [DIO](https://web.dio.me/track/potencia-tech-ifood-programacao-do-zero#state=f722d6e0-a3bd-4c14-8ab7-c87339d28a89&session_state=4cb6a294-dce1-4544-82f0-2af43a1f89e7&code=517d1289-8015-46c9-a488-210dd5e96aa2.4cb6a294-dce1-4544-82f0-2af43a1f89e7.a889d5a2-0d02-46df-83a5-28a1b4ac39ab) and am currently improving my skills at [Mackenzie](https://www.mackenzie.br/) Here i'll share some of my projects as i grow :)
